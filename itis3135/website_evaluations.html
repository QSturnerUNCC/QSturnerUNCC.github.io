            <section>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/">www.apple.com</a>

                <p>
                    Apple.com is Apple Inc.'s official website, which has a variety of functions and features, including but not limited to: 
                    descriptions of products, listings of specifications of products, support, and an online store to purchase products.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>C</b> - Apple.com has a high level of contrast in respect to colors, as the colors black and white are commonly used in relation to one another. Several types of font weights are also used to denote specific elements of the webpage to direct the viewer's attention to the appropriate places.</li>
                    <li><b>R</b> - One of the areas apple.com's design excels in, repetition is present throughout the website. For example, the layout of each page is similar; one horizontal section after another, then smaller block sections arranged in a 2x2 array. </li>
                    <li><b>A</b> - The alignment of the content on apple.com is consistently center-aligned, a unique feature of apple's website. This also falls into the category of R (repetition).</li>
                    <li><b>P</b> - The proximity of items throughout apple.com is appropriate; items close together indicating relationship between the items and vice versa.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Overall, apple.com strictly adheres to the CRAP principles of design, which explains why most people agree that the site has am excellent design.

            <section>
                <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">www.art.yale.edu</a>

                <p>
                    Art.yale.edu is the webpage for the Yale School of Art. 
                    It contains information on the school, how to apply, exhibits, public events, and news about campus events.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>C</b> - Art.yale.edu is a prime example of <i>too</i> much contrast. Nearly every color on the rainbow is present on the website, which is most likely overwhelming to the majority of audiences. The contrast between font sizes is jarring as well since a variety of sizes are used throughout the site.</li>
                    <li><b>R</b> - There is very little repetition in the design of this website. The sole example of repetition that adds positively to the design are some of the text headers, which are highlighted in white and the text color is black.</li>
                    <li><b>A</b> - The alignment on this site is very noticeable right off the bat. While the text's alignment is mostly adequate, the elements of the larger sections of the website are aligned to the center-left. The content is a position such that the viewer's line of sight is relegated only to the left.</li>
                    <li><b>P</b> - Another one of the main design problems of this website is the proximity of items. Everything is clustered together in a near-incomprehensible mess. The clustering of all items creates an effect of overcomplexity that diminishes the user-friendliness of the site.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Art.yale.edu is a poorly designed website, which correlates with the apparent ignorance of CRAP. Personally, I found this website on an article listing the "Top 10 Worst Website Designs."
